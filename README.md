# Attention

> This fork is an attempt to address Konga's security vulnerabilities by lowering the number of default node packages. As a database, I propose Mongo or Sqlite.

A pushed image at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/willsenabr/konga is the outcome of this.

# Changes
## Grunt / Bower

I discovered some security vulnerabilities with Grunt, and Bower is too old, so why not use static assets and delete these dependencies?

## NPM packages that have not been updated

Because the project relies on a large number of vulnerable outdated packages, I uninstalled, replaced, and upgraded them whenever feasible.

## Konga Updates

I have no plans to add new Konga features; I only want to maintain the project operational after Kong made modifications and the project died ðŸ’€.


## Environment variables
These are the general environment variables Konga uses.

2. ##### Start Konga

The following command will start Kong in PostgreSQL database mode; port 8001 is used to manage Kong API Gateway; keep in mind that this port is not secure, so keep it as private as possible in production.

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Let's start Konga locally after starting Kong prerequisites.

```shell
# you should use Node (20x) required at .nvmrc
# install packages before
npm install

# then run node
npm start
```

You can start by using docker and the production image.

```shell
 docker compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml up -d
```


Konga will be listened on port 1337.

> If you're using docker compose examples, remember to change your Kong address to http://172.17.0.1:8001 to connect Konga.
